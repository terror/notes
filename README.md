## notes üìù

**notes** is a simple command-line utility that helps with managing a flat
directory of notes powered by fzf, fd and ripgrep.

### Installation

You can install the script onto your machine by simply copying it into the
appropriate location:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terror/notes/master/notes -o /usr/local/bin/notes
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/notes
```

### Dependencies

**notes** requires a few environment variables to be set, namely:

- `$EDITOR`: The text editor you'll be editing your notes with [default: `vim`]
- `$NOTE_DIR`: Path to your notes directory [default: `~/notes`]
- `$NOTE_EXT`: File extension of your notes [default: `md`]
- `$NOTE_FORMAT_COMMAND`: Command to run when formatting notes [default: `prettier --print-width 80 --prose-wrap always --single-quote true --tab-width 2 --write`]

Moreover, a few external dependencies are required for full usage of the
program, namely:
